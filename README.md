## Introduction

Employee attrition is a natural phenomenon in the workforce, and this project aims to understand and predict the factors contributing to it. By combining statistical techniques and machine learning models, we aim to provide valuable insights for organizations to manage and mitigate attrition.

## Dataset and Libraries

- The dataset used in this project is named 'Employee_Attrition.csv'.
- Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn were employed for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

## Data Preparation

- The dataset was imported and preprocessed to handle missing values, redundant columns, and encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to visualize feature distributions and patterns.

## Statistical Techniques

- Descriptive statistical analyses and correlation matrices were employed to understand feature relationships.
- Statistical tests such as T-tests and ANOVA were applied to evaluate the significance of selected features concerning attrition.

## Machine Learning

- The dataset was split for training and testing, and features were standardized and encoded.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction.
- Machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, were applied for predicting attrition.

## Hypothesis Formulation and Testing

- Hypotheses were formulated for key features, and statistical tests were conducted to validate these hypotheses.
